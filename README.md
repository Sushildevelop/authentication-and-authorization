# Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

Authentication and Authorization are crucial components of any application that deals with user data, ensuring secure access control mechanisms. While they are often mentioned together, they serve distinct purposes:

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the user or system trying to access the application.
- **Authorization**: Determines what actions or resources the authenticated user is allowed to access.

This section highlights the implementation and configuration details for Authentication and Authorization in this project.

## Authentication

### What is Authentication?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It answers the question, "Who are you?"

### Types of Authentication Supported
1. **Password-Based Authentication**:
   - Users can log in using their email and password.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using algorithms like bcrypt.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification (e.g., SMS, email, or an authenticator app).

3. **OAuth 2.0**:
   - Allows users to log in using third-party providers like Google, GitHub, or Facebook.

4. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:
   - Tokens are issued to authenticated users for stateless session management.
   - Tokens include claims that help identify the user securely.

5. **API Key Authentication**:
   - For service-to-service communication, API keys can be used to authenticate requests.

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**:
   - Users register by providing their credentials.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

2. **Login**:
   - Users provide their credentials, which are verified against stored information.
   - A token (e.g., JWT) is issued upon successful authentication.

3. **Token Renewal**:
   - Refresh tokens are used to renew expired tokens without requiring the user to log in again.

## Authorization

### What is Authorization?
Authorization is the process of enforcing access control rules. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

### Authorization Techniques
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
   - Each role has specific permissions to access application resources.

2. **Permission-Based Access Control**:
   - Fine-grained control by assigning specific permissions to individual users or roles.

3. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
   - Policies are based on user attributes (e.g., department, region).

4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
   - Resources have associated lists specifying which users or groups can access them.

### Authorization Flow
1. **Policy Definition**:
   - Define roles, permissions, and policies in the system.

2. **Access Verification**:
   - When a user makes a request, their role and permissions are checked to determine whether the action is allowed.

3. **Dynamic Policy Updates**:
   - Authorization policies can be updated dynamically without affecting the system's availability.

## Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data (e.g., tokens, passwords) is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent brute force attacks, rate limits are applied to authentication endpoints.
- **Audit Logs**: Track authentication and authorization events for monitoring and compliance.
- **Session Management**: Handle session expiration and revocation securely.
